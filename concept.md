# Dynamics_A1130-II

# Chapter 12: Kinematics of a particle (Greg)
- projectile motion simulator, themed around helping Santa delivering presents
- erratic motion simulator, constructing state variable plots (position, velocity and acceleration) to live input in real time.

# Chapter 13: Kinetics of a particle: force and acceleration
- Simulation of a forked rod moving a particle along a general path (problem 13-88 and its variations). The equation of the path can be specified by the user. We are mainly aiming to show how the angle between the polar and nt coordinate system changes (equation 13-9).

# Chapter 14: Kinetics of a particle: work and energy (Greg)
- Simulation of a simple pendulum, with plots of the kinetic and potential energy stored in the system.

# Chapter 15: Kinetics of a particle: impulse and momentum (Máté)
- 1D impact simulator of two particles, every parameter of the problem can be changed

# Chapter 16: Planar kinematics of a rigid body
- simulator that shows the IC and its locus of a gear in a gear system and the motion as "seen" from the IC.
- vector plot of the velocity and acceleration field of a rigid body undergoing planar motion (to show that contrary to the IC, the instantaneous centre of acceleration does not exist).

# Chapter 17: Planar kinetics of a rigid body (Máté)
- detailed simulation and explanation of problem 17-106 (the two colliding cars).
- extension of the erratic motion simulator from chapter 12 with rotational input.
- Simulation of problem 16-71 (spool pulled with rope) in a parametric way.

# Chapter 18: Planar kinetics of a rigid body: work and energy
- Change the pendulum from chapter 14 to a physical pendulum.

# Chapter 19: Planar kinetics of a rigid body: impulse and momentum: 
- Simulation of the Moon lander problem form the 2023 exam. The geometry of the lander and the initial conditions can be varied.
